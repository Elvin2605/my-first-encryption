# PGP Encryption Tool

A modern, web-based tool for generating PGP keys, encrypting, and decrypting messages using the **Web Crypto API**. This repository demonstrates the concept of PGP encryption, where public and private keys are used to securely encrypt and decrypt messages.

Whether you're learning about PGP encryption or building a secure messaging system, this tool provides a simple and practical implementation.

---

## Features

- **Key Generation**: Generate PGP-compatible public and private keys using the Web Crypto API.
- **Message Encryption**: Encrypt messages using a recipient's public key.
- **Message Decryption**: Decrypt messages using your private key.
- **Easy-to-Use**: Clean and modular codebase with clear examples.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pgp-encryption-tool.git
   cd pgp-encryption-tool
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the tool.

## How It Works

### Key Generation
The tool uses the **Web Crypto API** to generate RSA key pairs (public and private keys). These keys are stored securely and can be used for PGP encryption and decryption.

### Encryption
To encrypt a message:
1. Provide the recipient's public key.
2. Enter the message you want to encrypt.
3. The tool will output the encrypted message in ASCII-armored format.

### Decryption
To decrypt a message:
1. Provide your private key.
2. Enter the encrypted message.
3. The tool will decrypt the message and display the original content.

## Usage Examples

### Generating Keys
```javascript
import { generateKeyPair } from '../lib/utils';

const { publicKey, privateKey } = await generateKeyPair();
console.log('Public Key:', publicKey);
console.log('Private Key:', privateKey);
```

### Encrypting a Message
```javascript
import { encryptMessage } from '../lib/utils';

const encryptedMessage = await encryptMessage('Hello, World!', publicKey);
console.log('Encrypted Message:', encryptedMessage);
```

### Decrypting a Message
```javascript
import { decryptMessage } from '../lib/utils';

const decryptedMessage = await decryptMessage(encryptedMessage, privateKey);
console.log('Decrypted Message:', decryptedMessage);
```
